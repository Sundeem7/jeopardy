- Project: https://github.com/shawn-e-harris/jeopardy/projects/1

## Overview
The goal of this project was to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a game 
that involved manipulating the DOM. I chose to create the popular game of Jeopardy 
that came with its own unique challenge of not only earning points, but also racing against the clock.


## How to play
1. Click the Start Button
2. Select a question from a category
3. Select an answer from the choices given
4. You will earn points if the answer chosen is correct, but will lose points if the answer is not correct.
5. To win you need 3000 points. You lose if you get -2000 points.
