## Overview
The goal of this project was to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a game 
that involved manipulating the DOM. I chose to create the popular game of Jeopardy 
that came with its own unique challenge of not only earning points, but also racing against the clock.


## How to play
1. Click the Start Button
2. Select a question from a category
3. Select an answer from the choices given
4. You will earn points if the answer chosenis correct, but will lose points if the answer is not correct
